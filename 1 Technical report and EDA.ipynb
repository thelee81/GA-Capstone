    "Image processing and application is a fast growing trend in recent years. This trend got the interest of many semiconductor manufacturing companies to make image sensors (CCD / CMOS) to tap the sensor market share. Application of image sensors could range from cheap toys to satellite. Price and quality of the sensor varies depending on which application specification its being manufactured, price can range from few cents to couple of thousand dollars depends. This project tackles the quality aspect of the image sensor thus saving cost on defect finding process flow and prevents defective sensors reaching high sensitive applications such as medical instruments, autonomous vehicles or aerospace equipments.  \n",

    "Each images sensor tested produce megabyte worth of various kind of data and one of them is image during testing process. There are many strict control work flows introduced by various teams involved minimise, eliminate or track quality compromising scenarios. One of the scenario is that testing process yield for high cost batch of products falling below the estimated yield, which is an anomaly and expensive one if it is false. False anomalies are flagged when instruments in testing platform malfunctions or human error by manufacturing operations staff. In such scenario a trained staff has to check each image data manually to confirm the flagged batch is indeed an anomaly thus appropriate team can make decision how to proceed with that batch of products if not anomaly batch could be moved to next process as per normal flow.\n"

As hinted above with regard to the variance in pixel intensity values, single pixel statistics do not provide rich enough descriptions of textures for practical applications. Thus it is natural to consider the second-order statistics obtained by considering pairs of pixels in certain spatial relations to each other.\n",
